# SRMS(Student Result Management System)
# This was a personal project to get acquainted to Spring Boot Architecture with React Frontend
# The project goal is to develop a web application with dynamic UI for a test series application which can host tests for various courses for        students who want to enroll in a particular course
# The admin can create tests using pre-existing questions or create new questions, also while being able to customise the test parameters
# The test is submitted as a submission entity which is then assessed to generate a score that can be later reviewed by the student
#
# The overal goal is to gain comprehensive knowledge and practice about Spring Boot Annotations, Layered Architecture and Project Business Model Designing
